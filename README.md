Basketball Team Stats

This is the second program made while doing the Treehouse Python Techdegree course.

This program will import and handle information about basketball teams. 

Criteria:

- Create a file name app.py or application.py which contains the entry point to start your program logic.

- Import and use the data from constants.py in your program. Do not modify or mutate the imported data from constants.py in any way. 

- The script should not crash due to uncaught exceptions. Raised exceptions should be handled appropriately so the program can continue or exit without a crash.

- Function calls, print statements, or any calculated execution logic should be wrapped inside a Dunder Main statement for your script.

- Additionally clean the guardians string so that it becomes a List of strings. Remove the and between the names and storing each guardian in a List together for that player.

- Also balance players in a way that also ensures teams have equal numbers of experienced vs inexperienced players.Teams still must be balanced with the same number of players.

- The user should be re-prompted with the main menu until they decide to "Quit the program".

- Display stats: Total number of inexperienced players; Total number of experienced players; Average height of the team; The guardian names of all the players on the team (joined together as a comma-separated string not displayed as a List object).
