Basketball Team Stats
This is the second program made while doing the Treehouse Python Techdegree course.

The object was to import team data from another file (constants.py), clean the data according to the instructions and make sure that there was an equal number of players per team. 

The clean_data function clean the player data according to instructions and returns a list with clean player data. Each player`s data is stored in a dictionary.

The balance_team function makes sure that there is an equal number of players per team and an equal number of experienced/inexperienced players. 

Then there is a function for calculating and returning avarage height; returning a string of player names, similar for guardians; and a last one for returning the number of experienced/inexperienced players.

The select_team function let the user select the team they would look at the stats for, and the main_program functions ties all of the above together into a user experience.
